Using the series of consistency principles,  atomic design structure coupled with a style guide consisting of a mood-board, colors and typography to build your own library and then a series of screens.
BUilding an animated high-fidelity prototype.

## 1. Styleguide

## 5. Desirability testing
- A desirability testing board with 25+ different adjectives.
- Pictures from the desirability test.
